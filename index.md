## Reflection Questions

### **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting topic that we have covered in our domain of AI drug discovery is using large language models for automated mining within literature. Did not realize how powerful AI can read thousands of PubMed abstracts and extract specific drugs to treat what. This is really fascinating and could speed up the drug repurposing research since it would take ages to do it by hand. This has shown that the process can make the research faster and larger in scope.

### **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

In Quarter 2, I would like to dig a bit deeper into the mechanisms that are behind drug repurposing. Investigating how knowledge graphs can improve this is a potential project idea. Instead of just taking the drug names out of the data or literature, SimLab is building a knowledge graph that connects all of these drugs, diseases, proteins, etc, using databases like DrugBank. To integrate the structured knowledge of the LLM extraction to find validating discoveries in relationships. If a drug targets a protein involved in many diseases, the knowledge graph can identify this, while a paper couldn't make predictions more reliable, rather than just patterns.

### **What is a potential change you'd make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

There is not much I would change about our approach in Quarter 1. It was great that we focused on a range of topics to familiarize ourselves with then later decide which aspect to further our research in. For Quarter 2, we will choose one of these topics and dive deeper into it. Instead of many different topics or ideas, we would have one big one to focus everything on. I would also change my time management better so I have plenty of time to work on everything without feeling rushed.

### **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

I am interested in the knowledge graphs constructions to connect drugs, diseases, proteins, and pathways. As well as to have a citation network analysis to identify the influence of that paper and track how evidence evolves. Finally, one technique that I would like to use most is to compare LLMs against Biobert or any form of keyword matching to see how the models compare and to see if the cheaper domain works just as well.
